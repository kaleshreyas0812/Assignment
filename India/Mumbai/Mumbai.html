            Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) is a densely populated city on Indiaâ€™s west coast. A financial center, it's
            India's largest city. On the Mumbai Harbour waterfront stands the iconic Gateway of India stone arch, built
            by
            the British Raj in 1924. Offshore, nearby Elephanta Island holds ancient cave temples dedicated to the Hindu
            god
            Shiva. The city's also famous as the heart of the Bollywood film industry.
