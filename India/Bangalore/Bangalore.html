            Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. The center of India's
            high-tech industry, the city is also known for its parks and nightlife. By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is a
            Neo-Dravidian legislative building. Former royal residences include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled
            after England’s Windsor Castle, and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.
